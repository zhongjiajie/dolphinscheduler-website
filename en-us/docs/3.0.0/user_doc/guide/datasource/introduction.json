For this reason we have to release DolphinScheduler's\ndistribute package without those packages, even if this will make more complicated for users. Datasource such as MySQL,\nOracle, SQL Server as the examples, but we have the solution to solve this</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>For example, if you want to use MySQL datasource, you need to download the correct JDBC driver from <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java\">mysql maven repository</a>,\nand move it into directory <code>api-server/libs</code> and <code>worker-server/libs</code>. After that, you could activate MySQL datasource by\nrestarting <code>api-server</code> and <code>worker-server</code>. Mount to container volume in the same path and restart it if you use container\nlike Docker.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If you only want to use MySQL in the datasource center, there is no requirement for the version of MySQL JDBC driver.\nBut if you want to use MySQL as the metabase of DolphinScheduler, it only supports [8.0.16 and above](https:/ /repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.16/mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar) version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
