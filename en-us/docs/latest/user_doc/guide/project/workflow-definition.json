Workflow DAG editing is the same as <a href=\"#creatDag\">Create Workflow Definition</a> <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line --></li>\n<li><strong>Online:</strong> When the workflow status is &quot;Offline&quot;, used to make workflow online.

When the number of master threads is insufficient, high priority processes will execute first in the execution queue, and processes with the same priority will execute in the order of first in, first out;\n* Worker group: The process can only be executed in the specified worker machine group. The default is `Default`, which can execute on any worker\n* Notification group: select notification strategy||timeout alarm||when fault tolerance occurs, process result information or email will send to all members in the notification group\n* Recipient: select notification policy||timeout alarm||when fault tolerance occurs, process result information or alarm email will be sent to the recipient list\n* Cc: select notification policy||timeout alarm||when fault tolerance occurs, the process result information or warning email will be copied to the CC list\n* Startup parameter: Set or overwrite global parameter values when starting a new process instance\n* Complement: two modes including serial complement and parallel complement. Serial complement: within the specified time range, the complements are executed from the start date to the end date and N process instances are generated in turn; parallel complement: within the specified time range, multiple days are complemented at the same time to generate N process instances.\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>You can select complement time range (only support continuous date) when executing a timing workflow definition. For example, need to fill in the data from 1st May to 10th May, as shown in the figure below:</li>\n</ul>\n  <p align=\"center\">\n      <img src=\"/img/complement_en1.png\" width=\"80%\" />\n  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Serial mode: the complement execute sequentially from 1st May to 10th May, and the process instance page generates 10 process instances;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Parallel mode: The tasks from 1st May to 10th May execute simultaneously, and the process instance page generates 10 process instances;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Workflow Timing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Create timing: Click Project Management-&gt;Workflow-&gt;Workflow Definition, enter the workflow definition page, make the workflow online, click the &quot;timing&quot; button <img src=\"/img/timing.png\" width=\"35\"/> , the timing parameter setting dialog box pops up, as shown in the figure below:<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"/img/time_schedule_en.png\" width=\"80%\" />\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Choose the start and end time.
