If <code>Default</code> is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.</li>\n<li>Environment Name: Configure the environment name in which run the script.</li>\n<li>Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task runs exceed the &quot;timeout&quot;, an alarm email will send and the task execution will fail.</li>\n<li>Sub-node: It is the workflow definition of the selected sub-process. Enter the sub-node in the upper right corner to jump to the workflow definition of the selected sub-process.</li>\n<li>Predecessor task: Selecting a predecessor task for the current task, will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Example</h2>\n<p>This example simulates a common task type, here we use a child node task to recall the <a href=\"shell.md\">Shell</a> to print out &quot;hello&quot;. This means executing a shell task as a child node.</p>\n<h3>Create a Shell task</h3>\n<p>Create a shell task to print &quot;hello&quot; and define the workflow as <code>test_dag01</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/subprocess_task01.png\" alt=\"subprocess_task01\"></p>\n<h2>Create the Sub_process task</h2>\n<p>To use the sub_process, you need to create the sub-node task, which is the shell task we created in the first step. After that, as shown in the diagram below, select the corresponding sub-node in position â‘¤.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/subprocess_task02.png\" alt=\"subprocess_task02\"></p>\n<p>After creating the sub_process, create a corresponding shell task for printing &quot;world&quot; and link both together. Save the current workflow and run it to get the expected result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/subprocess_task03.png\" alt=\"subprocess_task03\"></p>\n<h2>Notice</h2>\n<p>When using <code>sub_process</code> to recall a sub-node task, you need to ensure that the defined sub-node is online status, otherwise, the sub_process workflow will not work properly.</p>\n",
