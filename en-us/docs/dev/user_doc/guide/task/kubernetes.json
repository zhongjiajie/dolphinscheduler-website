In this task, the worker submits the task by using a k8s client.</p>\n<h2>Create Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Click <code>Project Management -&gt; Project Name -&gt; Workflow Definition</code>, and click the <code>Create Workflow</code> button to enter the DAG editing page.</li>\n<li>Drag from the toolbar <img src=\"../../../../img/tasks/icons/kubernetes.png\" width=\"15\"/> to the canvas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Parameters</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Description</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Node Name</td>\n<td>Set the name of the task. Node names within a workflow definition are unique.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Run flag</td>\n<td>Indicates whether the node can be scheduled normally. If it is not necessary to execute, you can turn on the prohibiting execution switch.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Describes the function of this node.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task priority</td>\n<td>When the number of worker threads is insufficient, they are executed in order from high to low according to the priority, and they are executed according to the first-in, first-out principle when the priority is the same.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Worker group</td>\n<td>The task is assigned to the machines in the worker group for execution. If Default is selected, a worker machine will be randomly selected for execution.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task group name</td>\n<td>The group in Resources, if not configured, it will not be used.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment Name</td>\n<td>Configure the environment in which to run the script.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of failed retries</td>\n<td>The number of times the task is resubmitted after failure. It supports drop-down and manual filling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Retry Interval</td>\n<td>The time interval for resubmitting the task if the task fails. It supports drop-down and manual filling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout alarm</td>\n<td>Check Timeout Alarm and Timeout Failure. When the task exceeds the &quot;timeout duration&quot;, an alarm email will be sent and the task execution will fail.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Namespace</td>\n<td>The namespace for running k8s task.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Min CPU</td>\n<td>Minimum CPU requirement for running k8s task.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Min Memory</td>\n<td>Minimum memory requirement for running k8s task.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Image</td>\n<td>The registry url for image.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom parameter</td>\n<td>It is a local user-defined parameter for K8S task, these params will pass to container as environment variables.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Predecessor task</td>\n<td>Selecting a predecessor task for the current task, will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Task Example</h2>\n<h3>Configure the K8S Environment in DolphinScheduler</h3>\n<p>If you are using the K8S task type in a production environment, the K8S cluster environment is required.</p>\n<h3>Configure K8S Nodes</h3>\n<p>Configure the required content according to the parameter descriptions above.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../img/tasks/demo/kubernetes-task-en.png\" alt=\"K8S\"></p>\n<h2>Note</h2>\n<p>Task name contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'</p>\n",
