If <code>Default</code> is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.</li>\n<li>Environment name: The environment in Security, if not configured, it will not be used.</li>\n<li>Task group name: The group in Resources, if not configured, it will not be used.</li>\n<li>Times of failed retry attempts: The number of times the task failed to resubmit. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.</li>\n<li>Failed retry interval: The time interval for resubmitting the task after a failed task. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.</li>\n<li>Delay execution time: Task delay execution time.</li>\n<li>Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task runs exceed the &quot;timeout&quot;, an alarm email will send and the task execution will fail.</li>\n<li>Condition: You can configure multiple conditions for the switch task. When the conditions are satisfied, execute the configured branch. You can configure multiple different conditions to satisfy different businesses.</li>\n<li>Branch flow: The default branch flow, when all the conditions are not satisfied, execute this branch flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Example</h2>\n<p>This is demonstrated using one switch task and three shell tasks.</p>\n<h3>Create a workflow</h3>\n<p>Create a new switch task, and three shell tasks downstream. The shell task is not required.\nThe switch task needs to be connected with the downstream task to configure the relationship before the downstream task can be selected.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../img/tasks/demo/switch_01.png\" alt=\"switch_01\"></p>\n<h3>Set conditions</h3>\n<p>Configure the conditions and default branches. If the conditions are met, the specified branch will be taken. If the conditions are not met, the default branch will be taken.\nIn the figure, if the value of the variable is &quot;A&quot;, the branch taskA is executed, if the value of the variable is &quot;B&quot;, the branch taskB is executed, and default is executed if both are not satisfied.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../img/tasks/demo/switch_02.png\" alt=\"switch_02\"></p>\n<p>Conditions use global variables, please refer to <a href=\"../parameter/global.md\">Global Parameter</a>.\nThe value of the global variable configured here is A.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../img/tasks/demo/switch_03.png\" alt=\"switch_03\"></p>\n<p>If executed correctly, then taskA will be executed correctly.</p>\n<h3>Execute</h3>\n<p>Execute and see if it works as expected. It can be seen that the specified downstream tasksA are executed as expected.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../img/tasks/demo/switch_04.png\" alt=\"switch_04\"></p>\n",
