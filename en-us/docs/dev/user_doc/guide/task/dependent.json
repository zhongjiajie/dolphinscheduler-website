For example, process A depends on the successful execution of process B from yesterday, and the dependent node will check whether process B run successful yesterday.</p>\n<h2>Create Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Click <code>Project -&gt; Management-Project -&gt; Name-Workflow Definition</code>, and click the <code>Create Workflow</code> button to enter the DAG editing page.</li>\n<li>Drag from the toolbar <img src=\"/img/tasks/icons/dependent.png\" width=\"15\"/> task node to canvas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task Parameter</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Node name</strong>: The node name in a workflow definition is unique.</li>\n<li><strong>Run flag</strong>: Identifies whether this node schedules normally, if it does not need to execute, select the <code>prohibition execution</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Descriptive information</strong>: Describe the function of the node.</li>\n<li><strong>Task priority</strong>: When the number of worker threads is insufficient, execute in the order of priority from high to low, and tasks with the same priority will execute in a first-in first-out order.</li>\n<li><strong>Worker grouping</strong>: Assign tasks to the machines of the worker group to execute. If <code>Default</code> is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Environment Name</strong>: Configure the environment name in which run the script.</li>\n<li><strong>Times of failed retry attempts</strong>: The number of times the task failed to resubmit.</li>\n<li><strong>Failed retry interval</strong>: The time interval (unit minute) for resubmitting the task after a failed task.</li>\n<li><strong>Delayed execution time</strong>: The time (unit minute) that a task delays in execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>The Dependent node provides a logical judgment function, which can detect the execution of the dependent node according to the logic.</p>\n<p>For example, process A is a weekly task, processes B and C are daily tasks, and task A requires tasks B and C to be successfully executed every day of the last week.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/dependent_task01.png\" alt=\"dependent_task01\"></p>\n<p>And another example is that process A is a weekly report task, processes B and C are daily tasks, and task A requires tasks B or C to be successfully executed every day of the last week:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/dependent_task02.png\" alt=\"dependent_task02\"></p>\n<p>If the weekly report A also needs to be executed successfully last Tuesday:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/tasks/demo/dependent_task03.png\" alt=\"dependent_task03\"></p>\n",
